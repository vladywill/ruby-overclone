Problem:
- Requests were not including the csrf token
Solution:
- Kevin: Moved JQUERY up to the top of my application.js file

Problem:
- User Model searching for username with the find_by method
Solution:
- Kevin: Validated email so needed to make that me searching reference



Left off:
- Finished user-auth and added the dynamic header functionality
- Problem with question reducer unable to read an 'id' or 'question'.
